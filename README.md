# Solitaire Game

> **NOTE** The code is based on the tutorial from [Python Arcade 2.6.17](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/card_game/index.html)

### Why did I do this?
I have decided to create my own Solitaire game because almost all current games use ADS or other stuff that I mostly don't enjoy having there.
Oh... And I love Solitaire as my time waste game : )

### How did I do it?

- Thought about the concept in my mind, tried to come up to something simmilar to the default Solitaire Game

- Graphic for the cards will be created by me, probably using Paint.net or Aseprite

- Code will be written in Python

### First version of the game can be run properly

Finally achieved the first version of the game! Below you can see an image of it:
