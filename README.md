# Solitaire Game

> **NOTE** The code is based on the tutorial from [Python Arcade 2.6.17](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/card_game/index.html)

### Why did I do this?
I have decided to create my own Solitaire game because almost all current games use ADS or other stuff that I mostly don't enjoy having there.
Oh... And I love Solitaire as my time waste game : )

### How to run it
In order to run it, you need:
- Python 3.10.9
- to install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

- to run the game, just use this command:

```bash
python game/game.py
```

> **NOTE** You can reset the game by pressing the `R` key on your keyboard, besides that you have to use the left-click of your mouse to move cards.

### Current version of Solitaire (v1.2.0)

The current version of Solitaire consists of all the features added by the versions:

- [v1.0.0](https://github.com/fabi200123/Solitaire-Game/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
- [v1.1.0](https://github.com/fabi200123/Solitaire-Game/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

### How did I do it?

- Thought about the concept in my mind, tried to come up to something simmilar to the default Solitaire Game

- Graphic for the cards will be created by me, probably using Paint.net or Aseprite

- Code will be written in Python
