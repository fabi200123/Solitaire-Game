### Why did I do this?
I have decided to create my own Solitaire game because almost all current games use ADS or other stuff that I mostly don't enjoy having there.
Oh... And I love Solitaire as my time waste game : )

### How did I do it?

- Thought about the concept in my mind, tried to come up to something similar to the default Solitaire Game
- Graphic for the cards will be created by me, probably using **Paint.net** or **Aseprite**
- Code will be written in **Python**

### Changelog since v1.0.0

- Cards can be dragged on top of piles (not limited to just mats)
- Updated the winning screen to be a little easter egg
