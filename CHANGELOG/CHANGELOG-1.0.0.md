# Solitaire Game - version v1.0.0

## Current versions

- [v1.0.0](https://github.com/fabi200123/Solitaire-Game/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

> **NOTE** The code is based on the tutorial from [Python Arcade 2.6.17](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/card_game/index.html)

### Why did I do this?
I have decided to create my own Solitaire game because almost all current games use ADS or other stuff that I mostly don't enjoy having there.
Oh... And I love Solitaire as my time waste game : )

### How did I do it?

- Thought about the concept in my mind, tried to come up to something similar to the default Solitaire Game
- Graphic for the cards will be created by me, probably using **Paint.net** or **Aseprite**
- Code will be written in **Python**

### Version v1.0.0

The game is now finally shaped and can be played properly:

This version of Solitaire offers these features:

- starting screen with different game difficulty options (**EASY** or **HARD**)
- timer + move counter display
- restart button (**R** key) that gets you to the starting screen
- win screen with option to restart and get back to the starting screen
